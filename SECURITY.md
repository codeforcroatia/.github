# Our Security Policy

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with Internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides community appreciation for critical vulnerabilities.

If youâ€™ve found a vulnerability, [submit it here](https://codeforcroatia.org/contact).

You can find useful information in our [forum](https://diskurs.codeforcroatia.org/) and [website](https://codeforcroatia.org).
